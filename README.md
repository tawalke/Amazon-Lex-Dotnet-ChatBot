# Amazon-Lex-Dotnet-ChatBot
My ASP.NET Core Project built for deployment on AWSLabs repo for Building Lex Bots with Amazon Lex, Visual Studio, and AWS .NET SDK 

Code allows for you to connect to any ChatBot created with Amazon Lex and deploy this bot to web by only **changing three (3)** configuration options.
